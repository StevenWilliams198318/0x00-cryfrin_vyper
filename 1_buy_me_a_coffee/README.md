I will be tackling a series of challenges to enhance my understanding of
smart contract development with Vyper in this contract.

1 - Getting Chainlink price feeds of a different asset on your fake chain.

2 - Writing a function to retrieve contract funds by getting
    the total amount of funds in the contract.
    2.1 - Iterate through the array of funders, and update how much they have funded!
    2.2 - Try not to just use self.balance!

3 - (Challenging!) Writing a function that allows for transfer of ownership of the contract
